Column Vector - list of vectors stacked on top of each other
```{r}
a <- c(1, 3, 2)
a
```

Transpose a vector- turning a column vector to row vector
```{r}
t(a)
```

Transposing twice turn back to column vector
```{r}
b <- t(a) 
c <- t(b)
c
```
Multiplying a vector by a number
```{r}
7 * a
```
Vector Addition
```{r}
a <- c(1,3, 2)
b <- c(2, 8, 9)
a+b

```
Inner product of vectors
```{r}
a.b = a1b1 + a2b2 + ...
sum(a*b)
```


Length (norm) of a vector
```{r}
sqrt(sum(a*a))
```
```{r}
# column by column matrix
A <- matrix(c(1, 3, 2, 2, 8, 9), ncol = 3)
A*7
```
```{r}
# row by row matrix
A <- matrix(c(1, 3, 2, 2, 8, 9), ncol = 3, byrow = T)
```


```{r}
# transpose of matrix
t(A)
```
```{r}
# Multiplication of Matrix and a vector

A %*% a
```
